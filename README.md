> Recruitment task to implement carousel design - made just with React & TypeScript, nothing else.

This was a really interesting case study to solve.
At the first glance, it seems like a very simple task, but it's not.

Problems I encountered: 
- implement the design (ideally) pixel-perfect,
- find out how to scroll the carousel:
  - by clicking the left/right buttons,
  - by wheel scrolling,
  - by touch (on mobile devices),
- how to make the carousel responsive,
- take care of internalization.

## Potential fields to improve
### File structure
This one isn't really bad, but I'd like to improve it. At the bigger scale, this could turn into something really messy.
In this case, maybe Emotion or Tailwind CSS would be a better idea than sticking to the CSS Modules to avoid creating a whole bunch of CSS files and flat the file structure a little bit.
### Improve the implemented design
It isn't recreated literally 1 to 1, but I tried my best to get it right.
